# SPADE and Association Rule Integration

This README provides an overview of the integration between SPADE (Sequential Pattern Discovery using Equivalence classes) and Association Rule mining.

## Introduction

SPADE is a popular algorithm used for discovering sequential patterns in a given dataset. It identifies frequent patterns by constructing an equivalence class-based representation of the dataset. On the other hand, Association Rule mining is a technique used to discover interesting relationships or associations between items in a dataset.

## Integration Overview

The integration of SPADE and Association Rule mining allows us to leverage the discovered sequential patterns to generate meaningful association rules. By combining the results of both algorithms, we can gain deeper insights into the relationships between items in a sequential dataset.

## Steps for Integration

To integrate SPADE and Association Rule mining, follow these steps:

1. Apply the SPADE algorithm to the dataset to discover frequent sequential patterns.
2. Convert the discovered sequential patterns into a suitable format for Association Rule mining.
3. Apply the Association Rule mining algorithm to the converted sequential patterns to generate association rules.
4. Analyze and interpret the generated association rules to gain insights into the dataset.

## Example Usage
